        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>I enjoy learning new things and being exposed to new ways of doing things, whether there are coding languages
          or how to improve my performance in a field (databases).</p>

        <h2>Technical Problems</h2>
        <p>My passion for solving technical problems started from an early age while fixing technical problems around my
          house alongside with my dad. </p>
        <p>In 2016, I decided to build up my knowledge by following a degree in Computer Science at the University of
          East London, where I was awarded with a 1st class degree.</p>
        <p> During my career I had couple opportunities to work on amazing projects and make a real impact in people's
          life by utilising my knowledge.</p>
